# Gauss with full pivot

The same process is carried out as in the Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, but the largest element is taken into account, in absolute value, among the elements of the sub-matrix, which results from eliminating the rows F1 through $Fk-1$ and the columns from the C1 through $Ck-1$ in matrix A, not counting the independent terms.
