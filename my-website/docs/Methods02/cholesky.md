# Cholesky

The Cholesky factorization is a derivation of the LU factorization. 

It takes its name from the mathematician Andr√©-Louis Cholesky, who found that a positive definite symmetric matrix can be decomposed as the product of a lower triangular matrix and the transpose of the lower triangular matrix $A = L * U$ where $Lii = Uii$ Therefore $A = LLT$ When applicable, the Cholesky decomposition is twice as efficient as the LU decomposition.
