# Doolittle

The Doolittle factorization method is considered a variation of the Crout method where matrix $A$ can be factored as $A = L * U$, matrix $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with unit diagonal and U is a higher triangular matrix. This factoring method is a recursive procedure, which consists of the successive decomposition of the major minors of the coefficient matrix $A$. In this case $A = L * U$ where $Lii = 1$
