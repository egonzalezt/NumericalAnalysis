## About this method

The simple Gaussian elimination method breaks down into two fundamental processes.

In the first, we carry out transformations on the system of equations using elementary operations until we obtain an equivalent system of equations whose matrix of coefficients is a superior triangular matrix.
In the second we use back substitution in the obtained system to find the solution.
