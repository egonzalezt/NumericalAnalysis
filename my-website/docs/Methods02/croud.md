# Croud

Croud In Crout's factoring method, matrix A can be factored as $A = L * U$ where matrix $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and $U$ is a higher triangular matrix with unit diagonal. This factoring method is a recursive procedure, which consists of the successive decomposition of the major minors of the coefficient matrix A. In this case $A = L * U$ where $Uii =1$
