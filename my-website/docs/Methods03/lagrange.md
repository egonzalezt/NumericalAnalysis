## About this method

The interpolating Lagrange polynomial, named after Joseph-Louis de Lagrange, is a way of presenting the polynomial that interpolates a given set of points. Given a set of $k+1$ points $(x_0,y_0),...,(x_k,y_k)$ where all $x_j$ are assumed distinct, the Lagrange interpolating polynomial is the linear combination.

$L(x) = \displaystyle \left (\sum_{j=0}^k y_il_i(x) \right)$
