## Objetive of the Method 

Find a root of a function from an initial value, a tolerance and a number of iterations, in this case it is not necessary to have an interval.

 
## Generalities
 
One of the conditions to guarantee the convergence of Newton's method is that $f'(Xv)$ has to be different from zero. If when executing Newton's method it is observed that $f'(Xn)$ approaches zero, the speed of the method decreases and there is a possible multiple root.
