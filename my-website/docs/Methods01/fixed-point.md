## About this method

$f(x)=0$ equation 1

In some cases it is possible to find the exact roots of the equation (1), for example, when $f(x)$ is a quadratic or cubic polynomial. Otherwise, in general, one is interested in finding approximate solutions using some (numerical) methods. Here, we will discuss a method called fixed point iteration method and a particular case of this method called Newtonâ€™s method.

A point, say, s is called a fixed point if it satisfies the equation $x = g(x)$. 

# Fixed Point Iteration

The transcendental equation $f(x)= 0$ can be converted algebraically into the form $x = g(x)$ and then using the iterative scheme with the recursive relation
