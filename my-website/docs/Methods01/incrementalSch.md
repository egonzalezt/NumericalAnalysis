## What is Incremental

The incremental search method is a numerical method that is used when is needed to find an interval of two values of $x$ that is meant to contain at least one root

The incremental search method starts with an initial value $X_0$, a final value $X_1$ (Lower and upper limits of the interval, respectively) and a constant called Delta. This constant is going to be added to the lower limit of the interval in each iteration in order to go from $X_0$ to $X_1$.
