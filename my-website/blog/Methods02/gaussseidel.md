## How to use it

To use this method you need these parameters

![Input](../../static/img/blog/gaussseidel.png)

- Matrix: Need to be as Mx(M+1) the last column is for the independent vector x
- Tolerance: value with error lower or equal than tolerance
- Iterations: or maximum iteration that your need to execute this method
### Example 

- Matrix:
$\begin{bmatrix}
    16 & 3 & | & 11 \\
    7 & -11 & | & 3 
\end{bmatrix}$

$\colorbox{red} {Required matrix expressed as extended matrix}$
